Good Evening,

First of all thank you for oppurtunity !!

My approach to exercises was:
1. Read the test case (question).
2. Run RSpec.
3. Try to understand problem.
4. If problem was familiar to me from previous exercises I opened www.repl.it and tried to solve them by breaking into the small pieces.
5. If problem was new to me I looked for more information (for example how to format date, if 3 dots in a range) on Ruby-doc.org, Stack Overflow, Google and tried to solved them.
6.Refactor code.


Thank You
